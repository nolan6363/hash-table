# Implementation of a Hash Table data structure in C.

## Capabilities

The hash table has been thought to be highly versatile, allowing for the use of any type for the keys and values.
Table expansion is done automaticaly, object insertion, deletion and retreival is possible.
I plan on adding asyncronous table expansion, to improve performance and provide more stable access times.
